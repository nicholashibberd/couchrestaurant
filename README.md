# Rails3 and [CouchRest::Model][crm] Example

Just a real quick getting up-and-running sort of example. The commit history is done in steps you'll need. Check that out.

The important part is the `Gemfile` an the `config/initializer/couchdb.rb`

This gemfile is using HEAD of [CouchRest::Model][crm] as of today sept 19, 2010. I'll try to remember to keep this example up to date with the gem, but if I forget, and it's causing you problems following along, let me know. I'll fix it up. --[will](github.com/will)
